Write a java program to compute all prime numbers less than equal to a given integer N using the
algorithm “Sieve of Erotosthenes”.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method used to compute all primes less than equal to N. We begin
by making an array of integers 2 to N. We find the smallest integer, i that is not crossed out, mark
i as prime, and cross out all of its remaining multiples such as 2i, 3i, … ..( actually better to start
at i2 and use increments i
2 + i, i2 + 2i, i2 + 3i,… etc until N). When i is > √𝑁, the algorithm
terminates.
Prompt the user to give an positive integer value N and print all primes up till N using the above
algorithm on screen.
